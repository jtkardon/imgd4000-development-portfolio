Version Control:
- We used GitHub for our version control
- Since most of the tech team was already familiar with GitHub we didn't have much trouble at the start
- We set up our GitHub so that no one could commit directly to main and we needed at least two reviewers on each pull request in order to make sure that main was always functional
- We quickly learned about the fact that only one person can edit each blueprint at a time
  - Our orignial solution to this problem was to just ask on our discord server if anyone was using a blueprint that we wanted to use
  - Eventually, we created a specialized channel in our discord where we say which blueprints we are currently working on to make everyone aware
- Since most of the art team was not familiar with the intricities of GitHub
